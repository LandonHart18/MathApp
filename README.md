# MathApp
Assignment: This is an individual assignment.  Create a console app that performs simple mathematics such as addition, multiplication, subtraction and division.  The app will ask the user which type of mathematical action they would like or if they wish to exit, if the user select a math option then ask the user  to provide 2 numbers; if the user opts to exit the program writes to the screen "Thanks for stopping by!" and exits.  If the user asks for division and the second number is zero advise the user that division by zero is not a valid choice and ask them to input a new number in place of zero. Do the math and then output to the screen the first number added or multiplied or divided or subtracted by second number = answer. (a + b = c) Define a class that contains the methods to perform the mathematical functions that get called within the app's Main function Consider which conditional and or iterative operators will handle the input best. Include data validation and error handling. Upon completion upload the zipped folder. Take a screenshot of the screen output and upload that as well.
